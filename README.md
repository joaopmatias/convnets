# Convolutional Neural Networks and image classification

## AI Sunsets (Workshop)
Coimbra, September 28th

## Software requirements
- Python 3
- Jupyter notebook
- Chrome extension: [Fatkun](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fatkun-batch-download-ima/nnjjahlikiabnchcpehcpkdeckfgnohf).
- This repository
- The zip files used in the code are also at [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1ZchcOIrjul7jAaDsDcAppBoCwYqIT9py).

**Packages**
- TensorFlow, Keras
- numpy, pandas, matplotlib
- six.moves (cPickle)


### Anaconda

It is recommended that the participants download the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) to obtain the necessary software.

Once installed, open it and check if all the packages above are installed, or install them otherwise.


### Google Colab

Google also provides the platform [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) that allows running the code directly from their servers and requires no set up.

This solution requires an internet connection and the computational power provided may vary.
